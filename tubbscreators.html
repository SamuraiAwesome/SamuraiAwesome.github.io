        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The Tubbs Force was created by two 10-year-old kids: Sam and Cole. 
        They came up with the idea based on an imaginary cat that
        rode to swim lessons with them on the roof of their car. Later on a third member
        was added to the team: Riley,an accomplished coder who was given access to the website in its creation stage.
        More members were added, including Noah, an accomplished young artist, Remy, and Luke, who has now quit the team. The team is now recruiting more members.</p>
